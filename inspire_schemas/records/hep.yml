        description: |-
            The main effect of setting this field to ``true`` is that the
            recoord is taken into account in the citation summary.  The need
            for this field arises because of limitations in the automatic
            recognition of cited papers in references: a record is flagged as
            citeable only if the common way to cite this record can be reliably
            recognized.  Currently, a record is automatically flagged as
            citeable if it has

            - sufficient information in `publication_info`: `journal_title`,
              `journal_volume` and (`artid` or `page_start`), *or*
            - an `arxiv_eprints` field.

            Besides, a record may be manually flagged as citeable by a curator
            if a user tracks and reports citations to that record.

            :MARC: ``true`` corresponds to ``980__a:Citeable``.

            CORE records are manually curated to ensure their metadata are up

            automatic treatment.

                An article, whether it is published or only a preprint. In the
                first case, `publication_info` contains information about the
                journal in which it was published.

            `book`

                The `editions`, `imprints`, `isbns` and `book_series` fields

                .. note::

                    A `proceeding` or a `thesis` is not considered as a `book`.

            `book chapter`
                A chapter in a book. The field `publication_info` contains
                information about the book of which this record is a chapter.

                `publication_info` contain information about the conference
                proceedings. In particular, `cnum` contains the identfier of
                the conference.

            `note`
                A note, not meant for publication.

            `proceedings`
                Proceedings of a conference. The `cnum` field contains the
                identfier of the conference. If published in a journal,
                `publication_info` also contains the journal information. If
                published as a book, the `editions`, `imprints`, `isbns` and
                `book_series` fields may contain specific metadata about this
